I worked as a dating coach for ten years. Over the course of that decade, after teaching several thousand men how to improve their lot with women, the main motivation I heard guys voice, over and over again, was, "I want better options." 

"I want to be the chooser," They would say. Our classes tended to get intimate in a hurry, and four sentences after meeting a stranger he'd be telling me, "I have girls in my life, but they're just not the right ones for me. How can I date better women?" or, just as common, "I want to date hotter girls." Sometimes they didn't say "date." 

No matter how they said it, I identified with it. It was familiar, even when it had been years since I myself was in a similar classroom for the same company, saying the same things. 

"I want hotter girls."

I had had girlfriends. Serious ones. I maintained a tumultuous relationship with my high school girlfriend for five years, off and on. I dated while I was in the United States Marine Corps, mostly meeting girls off the internet in the earliest versions of social media and online dating Sup, America Online chat rooms. All those girls still hold a warm place in my heart, even though our relationships, at the time, were tempestuous if they were anything. But when those serious relationships would reach their inevitably explosive conclusion, I would head once more into the online dating trenches and, once more, invest time and energy into a woman I may not have liked very much, and whom I would try to date except that she was the one who answered my ad on Yahoo Dating or-- a handful of times-- Craigslist. 

Because going out and meeting girls in the typical watering holes and parties common to young people in nearly any era seemed an insurmountable obstacle. What should I say? How could I start a conversation? Some guys take girls home the night they meet them! Was that even possible for me? 

It's worth noting right here and now that nowhere in that self-talk was even a faint remnant of what I would ask if I were in the dating arena today: should I take her home? Do I want to if I can? I held a certain awe of love, and I'd bought into the media version of love whole-heartedly, but the pull of unattached carnal touching preoccupied me in a way that overpowered any sense of yearning for love or an antidote to loneliness. 

I wanted to be wanted, and I wasn't. 

That's where I was when I became monomaniacal about fixing that problem. I was 23, confused and sad about why girls didn't seem to want me. Which is when I found this bizarre underground community of people who were similarly confused but determined to remedy the situation. This was the world of the secret underground seduction community, a world where grown men went by aliases like "Mystery" and posted "lay reports" online detailing there sexual successes (and failures) and attempting to describe what they said or did differently, consciously, than they might have in a similar situation before. 

Reading this, you're probably guessing correctly: it's extremely likely many of these reports of sexual conquest were lies designed to garner approval from interested parties. Of course. But enough of the information seemed to comport with my limited understanding of the human condition that reading the community's output, it seemed as if the scales had fallen from my eyes like Paul on the road to Damascus. 

Some of what I read were theories about human behavior that bordered on the absurd, and others that had the ring of truth. There were few arbiters of truth in the horny people's notes except the experience I gained trying out these crazy techniques night after night, weekend after weekend, drink after drink, ad nauseum. It was a lot of experience, and a lot of rejections-- more rejections than a mortal mind can really conceive at first. 

I stayed in touch with the company that trained me-- publishing my own thoughts and musings and observations and recording my failures on the company's private forum for people who had taken the seduction class. Eventually, gradually, I started having success. Attractive women who sparked desire in me started reciprocating it. Taking a pretty girl the night I met her wasn't such an extraordinary occurrence.

My tales of victory were noticed by the small group of people who ran the company, and on a fateful night, Mystery himself-- the greatest pick-up artist alive (I thought and cared deeply about)-- saw me getting phone numbers from a group of models. They needed instructors to help out on boot camps. 

I agreed, and for the next ten years, I taught workshops around the world. I met amazing men who had the courage to pay money, enter my classroom, and say, "I need help with this thing." I worked with a beautiful team of scoundrels who inspire me to this day. I seduced hundreds of women. And I drank way, way, way, way too much. 

As I write this in late 2019, I have years of distance between the time I spent teaching workshops and now. It's been four years since I last told a student, "Go approach her" or met a girl off Tinder. I met my nieces in that time. They're both troublemakers, and I would lie down in traffic for either of them.  I changed careers into a software engineer. And most importantly, I fell in love with my girlfriend, Joann. My ability with English is not equal to describing how much differently I view my life then and my life now.

But I never regretted the path I took toward understanding and the knowledge of the human condition I picked up after canoodling with hundreds of girls who wanted me, thousands of students, and many thousands more rejections than either. That's why I'm writing this book with Dan. (and not Tony) I was unkind with many women's hearts. I eventually became annealed to seeing at a perfectly nice, attractive girl crying in front of me, wounded by my casual disregard for her feelings. I was hardened despite the fact that I would sometimes take rejection with all the composure of one of my nieces during a tantrum. 

I look at my job as to teach you the really practical parts of what I learned about people through the years I taught with Love Systems, to state empathetically what I understand about the alchemy that happens when a man wand a woman collide with a man's desire on the line, with all the salacious tips and somber observations I can muster. 

I don't want my examples to seem like I'm telling war stories, even if I've had some pretty funny experiences. I take this book as seriously as I took my classroom: if you don't walk away with a clearer idea of how to approach women, I haven't succeeded. But I also want to make time to help you (and probably me) figure out what success actually means when we're talking about the heart, mind, and desire of another human being. 

Good luck. Happy hunting.
