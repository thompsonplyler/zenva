I want to discuss the organization of this Slack. I really love having this as a digital resource, and I'm grateful for it especially since I took my self-imposed exile from Facebook and thus ended up missing a whole bunch of pictures and updates until more people started participating here. 

During the long drive to Minnewaska State Park this weekend, though, some of us were discussing the different channels and our respective ability to keep up with/participate in conversations, and it seemed worthy of addressing as a group. Up front, I am totally fine with inertia. This isn't the Congregation at Nicea. We are church friends fanning the flames of our love for one another in the digital space. Warbling from the extant Slack channels is probably sufficient for that, warts and all. Any criticisms I have of this space are said with that in mind. I am interested in improving the readability of our conversations and allowing a space for people who want to babble about "off-topic" subjects not to feel like they're sucking all the oxygen from a room that isn't that interested.

*The action point is whether you guys feel we would benefit from more granular discussion channels.* 

Here are my propositions for channels:

*Remove:*
#random
#discussion

#random 
As ironic as it seems, #random doesn't really have a clear reason to exist, so it seems like it's a splinter of #general. If it were truly random, and we here clung to keeping it that way as a kind of exquisite corpse exercise with links and memes, it might make sense. As it stands, with no clear mission, it seems like it's just a branch from #general

#discussion
I think this was meant to be a discussion of Jesus/sermons/Bible, but since it's not clearly labeled, it 

Expand:
#coordinating
#resources-to-share
Our group is based around our church and our faith, but we are all friends, albeit friends with somewhat different tastes. That means that the logical solution, messy though it might be, would be a greatly expanded selection of channels for things like resources or coordinating.
Part of the issue with coordinating is that it's, like, coordinating what? I don't necessarily want to check coordinating for food because, well, I'm broke. But others may not want to coordinate on outdoor activities that are two hours away on a Sunday.
Similarly, in my coding Discord servers, resources are obvious: they are resources for coding. In my Pathfinder Discord, the resources are obvious. Here, it's not obvious at all. I DO want to see resources for, say, amazing sermons or YouTube videos like The Bible Challenge, but I may not want those in the same channel as "The 7 Best Belly Buster Burgers in NYC in 2019!!!!!"

Removing #discussion makes sense because we already have a general channel. "#sermon_discussion" or "#bible_discussion" would be useful. Alternatively, there could be an ongoing reading group like the one we have in Nahrae, Kevin's, Vanessa's, and my prayer accountability channel, where we're trying (WITH WILDLY VARYING DEGRESS OF SUCCESS) to follow a YouVersion Bible app study track on Paul's letters. So #bible_book_club_discussion would have a known conversation that extends through days.
Alternatively, I'd like to see a #taboo_discussion where people who want to talk about race relations or alt-right propaganda tactics or hating on Trump could gather.
Then, with all this, there's the next issue, which is if conversations are cordoned off into logical channels, which will almost inevitably create cliques or silos. That's fine. Some of us will gravitate more toward others, and churches in Seattle can still love churches in Tampa. But given the fact that Jesus should always, always, always be our guiding hand, I think it's worthwhile to call out potential towers of Babel early on.

Finally, there's also the more likely possibility: inertia. None of this is a big deal besides some small level of confusion.
